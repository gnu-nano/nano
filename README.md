# unano
unano is a small fork of Nano that adds a super small set of features to base Nano. If you want a stable editor that actually has a real userbase, use upstream Nano.

| This is the text window, displaying the contents of a 'buffer',    |
| the contents of the file you are editing.                          |
|                                                                    |
| The top row of the screen is the 'title bar'; it shows nano's      |
| version, the name of the file, and whether you modified it.        |
| The two bottom rows display the most important shortcuts; in       |
| those lines ^ means Ctrl.  The third row from the bottom shows     |
| some feedback message, or gets replaced with a prompt bar when     |
| you tell nano to do something that requires extra input.           |
